# verify-options show-validity

# Key Server for X.509 certificates
# Use LDAP or HTTP server for certificate lookups
# Example:

# Compliance modes
# Uncomment one if you need specific compliance:
# compliance gnupg    (default, maximum interoperability)
# compliance de-vs    (German VS-NfD compliance)

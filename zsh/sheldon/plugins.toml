# `sheldon` commands which are provided to assist in editing the config file:
#
# - `sheldon add` to add a new plugin to the config file
# - `sheldon edit` to open up the config file in the default editor
# - `sheldon remove` to remove a plugin from the config file
#
# See the documentation for more https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon#readme

You are placing a note into an Obsidian vault. Use the directory tree and sample filenames to infer each folder's purpose.

# Placement rules

- Pick the deepest subfolder that matches the note's topic
- Use sample note names as examples of what belongs in each folder
- Index/MOC files indicate a folder's scope — match against them
- When multiple folders could fit, prefer the one whose sample notes are most similar in topic and type to the new note
- Never place notes in infrastructure or template folders

# Ambiguity resolution

- Active work (projects, tracking, logs) → folders with dated or status-oriented notes
- Reference material (guides, how-tos, concepts) → folders with topic-oriented notes
- If still ambiguous, prefer the folder with the most topically similar sample notes
